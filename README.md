# Vue Jobs Example Site

This project is my first Vue.js project. It is a job board platform built with Vue.js. It allows users to browse, add, and manage job listings. The website is designed to cater to developers looking for Vue.js-related jobs and employers seeking talented Vue.js developers.

## Features

1. **Home Page**:
   - A welcoming banner targeting developers and employers.
   - Two primary actions: "Browse Jobs" for developers and "Add Job" for employers.

2. **Job Listings Page**:
   - Browse a variety of job listings.
   - Each job card displays job title, description, salary, location, and a "Read More" button.

3. **Job Details Page**:
   - Detailed information about the job.
   - Includes company contact details (email and phone).
   - Options to edit or delete the job listing.

4. **Edit Job Page**:
   - Allows employers to update job details, including job type, title, description, salary, location, and company information.

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - The website is optimized for desktop and mobile viewing.
